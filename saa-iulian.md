## Techniques and methodologies used so far

Since 1969 the ability of each individual to control one's muscle tension was observed and dully noted as presenting potential for various implementations.

 The degree of the forehead muscles contraction was pointed out through sounds of different pitch, the highest corresponding to maximum contraction and the lowest to full relaxation.

The subjects involved in the tests were invited to obtain the lowest sound pitch possible, properly financially motivated to get the best results.

In 1981, various researches were gathered to stress out the _matter's intelect_ including the importance of theta brain waves in relation to deep conscious muscle relaxation.
