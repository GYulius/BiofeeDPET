Wearables for monitoring Parkinson’s disease
PD is characterized by diverse and fluctuating movement abnormalities. People living with PD require longitudinal assessment of their symptoms to guide personalized management: in particular, clinicians must have an accurate understanding of how patients’ motor symptoms vary throughout the day to effectively guide medication adjustments.Expand Reference This is particularly important given the frequent and variable treatment-related motor complications patients can experience, such as motor fluctuations and dyskinetic movements.

At present, for many patients, disease monitoring is episodic in the form of clinic visits. The efficacy of the management of PD in patients is based on clinicians’ global assessments, which may use clinical assessment tools such as the Movement Disorder Society – Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) or evaluations such as the Hoehn and Yahr staging.Expand Reference There are significant limitations to the use of MDS-UPDRS for monitoring the progression of PD. The infrequent nature of clinic reviews means that only a brief snapshot of the disease course is captured. Moreover, MDS-UPDRS scoring is subjective (with some inter-rater variability), and the variable nature of PD means symptoms measured in the clinic may not be representative of their motor symptoms in the community.

To try to overcome some of the above-mentioned limitations, there has been research on home monitoring, where patients collect data on their symptoms in between clinic visits (e.g. by completing either paper-based or electronic symptom diaries).
 Issues with the use of diaries, such as recall bias, mismatch between patient-subjective self-reporting of function and objective ratings and problems with patients not consistently inputting data due to diary fatigue, have been noted.
 Other methods of home monitoring, such as telemedicine video consultations, suffer the same problems as in-person clinic visits as they still only provide a snapshot assessment of the patient’s symptoms.Expand Reference

Wearable devices for monitoring PD are, at face value, a highly exciting prospect. Technological advancements have produced user-friendly wearables with long battery lives, which can be worn by patients with PD at home during the day to unobtrusively assess motor symptoms. Motor symptoms that can be monitored by wearable devices include bradykinesia, tremors, motor fluctuations, postural instability, gait disturbance and dysarthria.
 Such wearables have the potential to provide more objective and continuous assessments of symptoms compared with symptom diaries or intermittent clinic visits/examinations. They are of particular importance, given the global shortage of neurologists available to perform regular clinical assessments: amongst Medicare patients in the USA living with PD, >40% have not seen a neurologist, and in the UK, published waiting lists for all routine hospital treatments are predicted to reach a peak of 8 million by summer 2024.
 In this sense, the data from wearables may be helpful in improving not only the quality, but also the accessibility of PD disease/symptom monitoring.

Compared with its use in the diagnosis of PD, wearable technology in PD monitoring is a more established field, with several commercially available products in use within healthcare settings. In the UK, the NICE guidance published in January 2023 now conditionally allows healthcare providers to offer devices for remote monitoring of PD.16Expand Reference Five devices fall within the guidance: Kinesia 360™ (Great Lakes NeuroTechnologies, Cleveland, OH, USA), KinesiaU™ (Great Lakes NeuroTechnologies, Cleveland, OH, USA), PDMonitor® (PD Neurotechnology Ltd, London, UK), Parkinson’s KinetiGraph (PKG; PKG Health Ltd., London, UK) and STAT-ON Holter™ (Sense4Care SL, Barcelona, Spain) (see Table 1).

 A 2022 National Institute for Health and Care Research-commissioned report of the five devices assimilated the evidence to date, including 57 studies of PKG, 15 of STAT-ON, 3 of Kinesia360, 1 of KinesiaU and 1 of PDMonitor.15Expand Reference

#Devices:

##PKG

###Description of device:

Wrist-worn device, which is used for 6–10 days and provides objective motor measurements of bradykinesia, dyskinesia and tremor. Data are also collected about immobility, medication adherence and tendency to impulsiveness.23Expand Reference

It is a regulated class IIa medical device and has received clearance to be used in Australia, Europe and the USA

###Relevant research to date:

In many studies, the use of PKG data in addition to clinical assessment by doctors led to changes in PD management.
 One study also reviewed PKG acceptability and demonstrated that 82% of participants found the PKG easy to use and 74% found PKG to be somewhat or highly valuable in providing data to manage their PD56Expand Reference

##STAT-ON

###Description of device:

Waist-worn inertial recorder. It measures dyskinesia, ‘on’ and ‘off’ periods, gait (including freezing of gait and bradykinesia), falls, energy expenditure and posture. Similar to PKG, the STAT-ON should be worn for at least 5 days.

It is a CE safety-marked class IIa medical device, certified for the European market

###Relevant research to date:

There is less published evidence regarding the STAT-ON device, with the majority of the evidence focused on diagnostic accuracy.
 There is limited evidence about patient or clinician opinions, which are generally favourable but a lack of evidence regarding the correlation between STAT-ON use and clinical outcomes

##Kinesia360 and KinesiaU

###Description of device:

Kinesia360 is a wrist- and ankle-worn monitoring system linked to a smartphone application, whereas the KinesiaU uses off-the-shelf smartwatch technology paired with the Kinesia application to monitor Parkinson’s symptoms. KinesiaU is marketed more at consumers to monitor and manage their own condition, whereas Kinesia360 is aimed at clinicians.

Kinesia360 is a class I CE safety-marked and FDA-approved medical device; the KinesiaU motor assessment system is currently cleared for sale in the USA, the UK, the EU and Canada

###Relevant research to date:

Diagnostic accuracy is rated as moderate to good with Kinesia360.63Expand Reference There were three small studies examining clinical outcomes using the Kinesia systems, and although there were some indications that there may be motor and quality of life improvements, the study cohorts were too small to be definitive

##PDMonitor

###Description of device:

A wearable system consisting of five devices worn on the limbs and the waist. Data on bradykinesia, dyskinesia, tremor, gait (including freezing), postural instability, ‘on’ and ‘off’ periods and activity levels are collected.

It is a CE safety-marked class IIa medical device, certified for the European market

###Relevant research to date:

There is limited published evidence regarding the use of the PDMonitor system, and evidence regarding clinical outcomes is limited to a couple of case reports
