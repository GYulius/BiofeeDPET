# **Design Patterns**

## Command Pattern:

The Smartwatch class holds commands and can invoke them.
The Feedback class is the receiver that performs actions when commands are executed.


## State Pattern:

The TremorDetector class is the context that changes states.
The NormalState and TremorDetectedState classes implement the behavior based on the current state.
