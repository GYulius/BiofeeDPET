# BiofeeDPET

Biofeedback system using wearables as smart watches and mobile devices aimed to support individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Essential Tremor (ET) conditions.


### UPDATE 2024-10-07

Hello all,

This project has started as a lab activity within Advanced Software Engineering Techniques (ASET) at Computer Science Faculty - “Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University – Iasi, Romania, and includes an open invite to other master students and for scholars involved in research doctorates in this domain or related fields.

This repo is intended to support and extend the efforts that have been made in this area of study in order to bring the newest technologies to those who want to help themselves related to a specific condition.

To use all of the functionality of this app, you should have:

The following requirements are optional, but can improve or extend functionality in some situations:

### Troubleshooting:

### Developing:
To work on this project, first make sure you have all the requirements listed.
Before a release, the version number is bumped in README.rst.
Version tags are then created using

`git config gpg.program gpg2 && git config user.signingkey xxxxxxxxxx && git tag -s VERSION_GOES_HERE -m "Version VERSION_NO"`.

Releases are done by running `make-release.sh VERSION_NO` to build the source packages, sign them, and upload them.

### Testing:
To run all the tests:

To run static analysis:

Testing is also done automatically by GitHub Actions, upon every push.
